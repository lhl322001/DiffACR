## Usage

We provide demo codes for end-to-end inference here.
Our inference codes will iterate all images in a given folder, and generate the results.

### Quick start 


### Training

This demo runs RACIDiff Model with ARMCD images.

```bash
python train.py --epochs 2000 --time_steps 50 --input_dir None --output_dir ./output --localmask_dir ./mask
```

After runnng, it will generate the model results in the folder  ./output and the localmask results in the folder ./mask
